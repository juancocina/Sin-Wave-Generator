#NOTE 
This does work on my machine. However, the Build/MacOS/ is missing in this repository. Github Desktop was giving me an error so I 
simply excluded the folder.
- If you wanted to build this project on your Mac, simply install the projucer, create a new Audio project,
 and copy the source files from my project onto your new project.
- Here is a link to the frameworks website: https://juce.com/

I have since uploaded a screenshot of the final working product onto my portfolio at https://juancocina.github.io/.
